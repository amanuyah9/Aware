# AI Grade Scanning - Complete Implementation Guide

## Overview

The AI Grade Scanning feature allows students to upload photos of their syllabus and gradebook, and automatically create courses with all assignments pre-filled. The system uses OpenAI GPT-4 Vision for OCR and intelligent parsing.

## Architecture

### Frontend Flow

1. **ScanPage** (`src/pages/ScanPage.tsx`)
   - Multi-file upload interface
   - Image preview with remove capability
   - Upload progress tracking
   - Calls Edge Function for processing

2. **ScanPreviewPage** (`src/pages/ScanPreviewPage.tsx`)
   - Displays extracted data
   - Allows editing before confirmation
   - Creates course + assignments in database
   - Links scan to created course

3. **ScanPreview Component** (`src/components/Scan/ScanPreview.tsx`)
   - Loads scan data from database
   - Renders editable form fields
   - Handles data validation

### Backend Flow

1. **Supabase Storage**
   - Bucket: `scan-images`
   - Organized by scan ID
   - Public read access for OpenAI

2. **Edge Function** (`process-scan`)
   - Deployed to Supabase
   - Uses OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API
   - Processes images in sequence
   - Merges results with confidence scoring

3. **Database** (`scans` table)
   - Stores upload metadata
   - Tracks processing status
   - Saves parsed results
   - Links to created courses

## Data Flow

```
User uploads images
    ↓
Images stored in Supabase Storage
    ↓
Edge Function invoked with image URLs
    ↓
For each image:
  - Send to OpenAI GPT-4 Vision (OCR)
  - Parse structured JSON with GPT-4
  - Store confidence scores
    ↓
Merge all parsed results
    ↓
Save to scans table
    ↓
User reviews in ScanPreviewPage
    ↓
User confirms
    ↓
Create course + assignments
    ↓
Redirect to course page
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. ScanPage Upload Flow

```typescript
// User selects files
handleFileSelect() {
  - Create File objects
  - Generate preview URLs
  - Add to state
}

// User clicks "Upload and Process"
handleUploadAndProcess() {
  1. Create scan record (status: 'uploading')
  2. For each file:
     - Upload to Storage
     - Get public URL
     - Mark as uploaded
  3. Update scan (status: 'uploaded')
  4. Call Edge Function
  5. Wait for completion
  6. Redirect to preview
}
```

### 2. Edge Function Processing

```typescript
processScan(scanId, imageUrls) {
  1. Update scan (status: 'processing')
  2. For each image:
     - performOCR(imageUrl)
       • Send image to GPT-4 Vision
       • Extract all visible text
     - parseStructuredData(ocrText)
       • Send text to GPT-4
       • Request JSON format
       • Get structured data
  3. mergeParsedData(parts)
     - Combine category info
     - Deduplicate assignments
     - Average confidence scores
  4. Update scan with results (status: 'completed')
}
```

### 3. Preview and Confirmation

```typescript
ScanPreviewPage {
  1. Fetch scan from database
  2. Display in ScanPreview component
  3. User edits fields if needed
  4. On confirm:
     - Create course with categories
     - Bulk insert assignments
     - Link scan to course
     - Redirect to course
}
```

## Database Schema

### Scans Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE scans (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  image_urls text[],           -- Array of storage URLs
  ocr_texts jsonb,              -- Raw OCR output
  parsed_parts jsonb,           -- Individual parse results
  merged jsonb,                 -- Final merged result
  status text,                  -- 'uploading', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed'
  linked_course_id uuid,        -- Reference to created course
  created_at timestamptz,
  updated_at timestamptz
);
```

### Merged Data Format

```json
{
  "courseTitle": "Introduction to Biology",
  "teacher": "Dr. Smith",
  "term": "Fall 2025",
  "gradingModel": "weighted",
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": "homework",
      "name": "Homework",
      "weight": 30,
      "dropLowest": 1
    }
  ],
  "assignments": [
    {
      "title": "Homework 1",
      "category": "homework",
      "earnedPoints": 95,
      "totalPoints": 100,
      "date": "2025-01-15"
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.89
}
```

## OpenAI Integration

### OCR Prompt

```
Extract all text from this image. Include everything you see:
course names, assignment names, scores, dates, categories, weights,
percentages, and any grading information. Be thorough and precise.
```

### Parsing Prompt

```
You are an expert at parsing academic gradebooks and syllabi.
Extract structured data from the provided text and return it as JSON.

Expected JSON structure: { courseTitle, teacher, term, gradingModel,
categories: [{id, name, weight, dropLowest}],
assignments: [{title, category, earnedPoints, totalPoints, date}],
confidence }

If information is missing, omit those fields.
Be conservative with confidence scores.
```

## Mock Mode

When `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not configured:

```typescript
// Generate sample data instead of calling API
parsedParts = imageUrls.map((_, index) => ({
  courseTitle: 'Mock Course from Scan',
  teacher: 'Dr. Smith',
  term: 'Fall 2025',
  gradingModel: 'weighted',
  categories: [...],
  assignments: [...],
  confidence: 0.85,
}));
```

This allows full testing without API costs.

## Error Handling

### Upload Errors
- Storage permission denied → Check RLS policies
- File too large → Add client-side validation
- Network failure → Retry with exponential backoff

### Processing Errors
- OCR failed → Log error, set confidence to 0
- Invalid JSON → Catch parse error, use empty object
- API rate limit → Queue for retry

### UI Feedback
- Progress messages during upload
- Processing spinner with status
- Error alerts with actionable messages
- Success confirmation before redirect

## Performance Considerations

### Image Upload
- Sequential upload (prevents rate limits)
- Progress tracking per image
- Check mark on successful upload

### OCR Processing
- Parallel processing of multiple images
- 30 second timeout per image
- Graceful degradation on failure

### API Optimization
- Single request per image for OCR
- Single request per image for parsing
- Reuse parsed results (cached in DB)

## Security

### Storage Access
- Users can only upload to their own folder
- Public read (needed for OpenAI)
- Automatic cleanup (optional)

### API Keys
- Stored as Edge Function secrets
- Never exposed to client
- Rotatable without code changes

### RLS Policies
- Users see only their own scans
- Course creation requires authentication
- Assignment insertion validated

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload single image
- [ ] Upload multiple images (3)
- [ ] Remove image before upload

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to upload image"
1. Check storage bucket exists: `scan-images`
2. Verify bucket is public
3. Check storage policies are set
4. Test with smaller image

### "Processing stuck"
1. Check Edge Function logs
2. Verify OpenAI API key is set
3. Check OpenAI account has credits
4. Try with single image

### "Low confidence scores"
1. Use clearer photos
2. Ensure good lighting
3. Try uploading fewer images
4. Crop to relevant areas

### "Wrong data extracted"
1. Edit in preview before confirming
2. Try different photos
3. Fall back to manual entry
4. Report issue for improvement
