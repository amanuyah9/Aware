## 🎯 Next Steps Recommendation

For the most impactful next feature, implement in this order:

1. **AI Scanning** (highest user value)
   - Start with mock mode
   - Add OpenAI integration later
   - Focus on UX first

2. **Stripe Payments** (enables monetization)
   - Test mode first
   - Simple checkout flow
   - Webhook for subscription updates

3. **Export & History** (frequently requested)
   - CSV export is easiest
   - PDF can use browser print

4. **Admin Console** (operational need)
   - Essential for support
   - Monitor scan quality
   - Handle abuse
